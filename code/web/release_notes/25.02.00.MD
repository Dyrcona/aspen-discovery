## Koha Integration Updates

- For libraries that use Koha as their ILS, and use the koha-plugin-newsletter-consent plugin
  - Administrator with the permission to edit library settings will be able to toggle on/off the 'Enable ILS-issued consents' setting under the 'Data Protection Regulations' section. (*CZ*)
    - if the Koha plugin has not been installed and enabled in Koha, then the 'Enable ILS-issued consents' setting will not appear as it requires the plugin to be installed and enabled. (*CZ*)
    - if the Koha plugin is uninstalled or disabled in Koha while 'Enable ILS-issued consents' is toggled on, 'Enable ILS-issued consents' will still display. (*CZ*)
  - If 'Enable ILS-issued consents' is enabled:
    - the 'Privacy Settings' options will appear in patron side menus. (*CZ*)
    - In the self-registration form, under a ‘Privacy’ section, patrons need to see information about the consent types set by their library in Koha. For example, they may be given the opportunity to receive the library’s newsletter. (*CZ*)
    - Patrons will be able to choose to opt in, which implies that consent is not assumed by default. (*CZ*)
    - Patrons will be able to submit their consent along with their registration form. (*CZ*)
    - Patrons will be sent to Koha, where it is stored. (*CZ*)
    - Patrons will be able to view and change their consent information (as retrieved from Koha) at any point through the ‘Your Account > Privacy Settings ’ section. (*CZ*)
    - If ILS consent is enabled in the Aspen settings, but the Koha plugin is disabled or uninstalled, patron will see an informative message in 'Privacy Settings'.  (*CZ*)
